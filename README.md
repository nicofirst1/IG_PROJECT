# final-project-for-interactive-graphics-course-meteorite-apocalypse


We implemented a game based on the Babylon.js framework, using physical engines,
meshes, textures, lights, particle systems and much more to create a playable environment.
Our focus was on the cyclic implementation of the character animations manually
coded, but also on the challenging aspect of the game.
In the documentation we analyze in detail every technical aspect and provide a user
manual with instructions for playing the game.
